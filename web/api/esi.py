"""Bringing the fittings a pilot has saved in game into pyfa.

The one endpoint here is not a database read: it talks to EVE over the network and
then writes to the caller's own database, in that order, so nothing is imported when
ESI cannot be reached. A fitting that cannot be built is reported in the answer
instead of failing the batch.

An ESI failure is answered with the code vocabulary of ``web/frontend/src/errors.ts``
plus the status the situation deserves: EVE being unreachable is a gateway error, a
login that EVE no longer accepts (or none at all) is the client's to fix by signing in
again, and anything unforeseen is the server's.
