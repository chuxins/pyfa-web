"""JSON API.

Endpoints under ``/api`` run with the caller's engine context bound (see
:mod:`web.deps`), so the service layer transparently reads and writes that user's
own database.

The event stream is the exception: it is a long-lived connection and therefore
must not hold the user's lock, so it lives on its own router.
