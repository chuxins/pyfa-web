"""Login, logout and "who am I".

A login that fails after EVE has sent the browser back cannot show it a message: the
browser is in the middle of a redirect chain and the reason may quote a token. So the
failure is answered with a redirect into the app carrying one of the codes from
:mod:`web.auth`, which the front end renders as a sentence of its own.
