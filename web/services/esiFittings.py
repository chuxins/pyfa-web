"""The fittings a pilot has saved in game, brought into pyfa.

ESI's character fittings endpoint answers with the fittings saved in the EVE client
-- the same list the desktop's "Browse EVE Fittings" window shows. Turning one into a
fit is already pyfa's own job (``service.port.esi.importESI``, reached through
``Port.importFitFromBuffer``), so what is added here is only what a server needs:
finding the tokens a login left behind, calling ESI, and not importing the same
fitting twice.

The tokens come from the SSO login, not from anywhere else: :mod:`web.auth` writes an
``SsoCharacter`` row -- encrypted refresh token included -- into the pilot's own
database when they sign in, and ``Esi.getFittings`` reads it back out of there. That
is the desktop's own object, so an access token that has expired is refreshed by
pyfa's own code; the refreshed row is written back below, which is the part the
desktop does from its token validation thread instead.
