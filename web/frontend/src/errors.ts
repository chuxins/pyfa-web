/**
 * Refused edits, said in the reader's language.
 *
 * `web/services/commands.py` answers a refused edit with an English sentence -- that is
 * what the log and any non-browser client see -- plus a `code` naming the reason and the
 * values that belong in the sentence. The templates below are those sentences, keyed by
 * code, so the catalogue in `i18n.ts` can translate them like any other chrome string.
 * The values themselves are game data (item, group and ship names), which the server has
 * already localized.
 *
 * Keep them word for word in step with `explain_module_refusal()` in that file: the same
 * sentence should not come out two ways depending on who renders it.
