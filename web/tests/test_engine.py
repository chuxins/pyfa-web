"""Game data language: which of eve.db's translated columns the server reads.

The front end's language and the game data's language are independent on purpose
(see docs/web.md, "Interface language"). This file covers the game data half: the
engine binds item names to a language column when it imports its models, so the
language has to be decided from the server config before that happens.
