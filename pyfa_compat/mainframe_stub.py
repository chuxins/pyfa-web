"""A stand-in for ``gui.mainFrame`` so pyfa's own fit commands can run headlessly.

``gui/fitCommands/gui/**`` are the real, undoable editing commands: they wrap the
``calc`` commands, run the state checks, recalculate, fill and notify. They are
exactly what the desktop application uses when a user drags a module into a slot.

Their only GUI dependency is ``gui.mainFrame.MainFrame.getInstance()``, and always
in the same way: as the *target* of ``wx.PostEvent``. Everything else they touch
(``gui.globalEvents``, ``gui.fitCommands.calc.*``, the service layer) is already
GUI-free or covered by the wx shim.

So registering this stub makes the whole editing layer reusable by the web server.
The event target is inert here; notifications are re-routed to the browser by the
``PostEvent`` hook in :mod:`web.events`.
